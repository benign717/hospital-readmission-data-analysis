Predictive analysis of 30-day hospital readmissions in Australia using AIHW and ABS data.
Predictive Analysis of Hospital Readmissions for Chronic Disease Patients in Australia
Project Overview
This project analyses Australian hospital admission data to identify patterns and predict 30-day readmissions for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and COPD. The goal is to assist healthcare providers and policymakers in reducing preventable readmissions through targeted interventions.

Dataset
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) – Hospital admissions and chronic disease statistics.

Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) – Demographic & socio-economic indicators.

MyHospitals – Hospital performance metrics.

Note: Public datasets are anonymised and free from personal health identifiers.

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for analysis & visualisation

GeoPandas / Folium for geospatial mapping

Git & GitHub for version control

Methodology
Data Collection & Integration – Merging hospital, demographic, and geographic data.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature encoding, scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends, outliers, and key risk factors.

Feature Engineering – Creating variables such as comorbidity index and socio-economic score.

Model Building – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluation – ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

Geospatial Mapping – Visualising readmission hotspots across Australia.

Key Findings (Sample)
Readmission risk is highest among patients aged 65+ with multiple chronic conditions.

Regional and remote areas have higher readmission rates due to limited follow-up care.

Socio-economic disadvantage correlates strongly with higher readmission probability.
